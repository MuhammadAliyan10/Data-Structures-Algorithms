# Time Complexity

### What is time complexity?

**Time complexity** _is way to represent the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of length of the input.ime complexity focuses on the growth rate of the runtime as the input size increases_

### What is Big O?

_Big O is the mathematical notation used to describe the upper bound of the time complexity of an algorithm. It captures the worst-case scenario and provides high-level understanding of the algorithm's by showing how the runtime increases relative to the input size._
